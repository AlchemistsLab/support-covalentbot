## D3 Orbat tree

Shows an ORBAT structure in a tree view similar to how it would displayed in a power point presentation. It is possible to show/hide subunits by clicking on the units, when a unit has hidden subunits it will be displayed in a slightly darker color.

This example is using D3 version 3 for rendering the ORBAT.
