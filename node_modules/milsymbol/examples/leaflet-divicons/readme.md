## milsymbol in LeafLet - L.divIcon()

You can use the SVG XML output directly in a L.divIcon(), this way you can also add other HTML information to your markers if you want to. This is the simplest way of using milsymbol in LeafLet, but might run into performance issues if you are using a very large number of symbols.

This example is using LeafLet 1.3.1.
