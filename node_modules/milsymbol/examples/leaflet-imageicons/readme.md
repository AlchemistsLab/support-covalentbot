## milsymbol in LeafLet - L.icon()

Using the toDataURL() method in milsymbol makes it possible to assign the output from milsymbol as an image source. This way you can use the output from milsymbol in ordinary L.icon() markers in LeafLet.

This example is using LeafLet 1.3.1 but will work without any problem in in LeafLet 0.7.3+.
